# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
Polishing up a current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images of Mars. Using specific libraries and an open source tool to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images. After the data is scraped it will be stored on a Mongo database and utilize a popular CSS framework that will enable responsive development of mobile-first website. Lastly, I will use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
